Although I initially began with R Studio for my data analysis work, as I delved deeper into my research and data set, I found myself drawn to the Python programming language, using Pandas to implement my ideas. The project that I initiated in R was subsequently uploaded to my Kaggle account under the name "lyffski," and I participated in the renowned Titanic competition. Through my R script, I delved into the most crucial aspects of the machine learning process, such as classification, exploratory modeling using the caret library, cross-validation, ggplots, sensitivity and specificity of positive and negative true/false rates, random forest, and predictions. Based on my script and the final submission for the Kaggle competition, I found myself captivated by the field of artificial intelligence and certain that it would not be my last foray into this area, particularly since the market for AI specialists is expanding at a tremendous rate. I could envision myself specializing in this exciting field of science at some point in the future.
