# Filter

The filter has multiple display variations. On click it can open up the filter-drawer

## States

- **has-value**: If the filter has a value set, then we display this value
- **multi-options**: If there is more than one option available we show a chevron to indicate that the filter can be opened (in the filter drawer)
